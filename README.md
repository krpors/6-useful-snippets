# 6-useful-snippets

Bruce Hill once created a blog post which granted me some insights in some great
algorithms useful in 2D (game) programming. The blog can be found [here](https://blog.bruce-hill.com/6-useful-snippets).

This repository contains the implementations of those snippets. Mainly for my
own reference for later, and in case the blog disappears.
